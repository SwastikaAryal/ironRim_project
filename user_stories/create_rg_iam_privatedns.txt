Description
The purpose of this user story is to establish a new resource group in our 
cloud environment, configure it with the necessary inherited IAM policies
to ensure proper access controls, and set up a private DNS zone for internal
resource naming and management. This setup will streamline resource organization,
enhance security, and improve internal network resolution.
