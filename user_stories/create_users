Description
As a DevOps engineer, I want to create user accounts for our team members in Azure DevOps (AzDo) so that they can access the necessary tools and resources for their development and operational tasks.

Acceptance Criteria:
User Creation Form:

The system should provide a form with fields for entering user details: first name, last name, email, username, password, and role.
Each field should be validated to ensure data integrity (e.g., email format, password strength).
Mandatory Fields:

The form should not be submitted if any mandatory fields (first name, last name, email, username, password, role) are missing.
Unique Constraints:

The username and email must be unique. The system should display an error message if the username or email already exists.
Password Requirements:

The password must meet specific criteria: minimum 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.
The system should display an error message if the password does not meet these criteria.
Role Selection:

The system should allow the admin to assign roles to the user (e.g., admin, editor, viewer).
The roles should be selectable from a predefined list.
Success Message:

Upon successful creation, the system should display a confirmation message: "User successfully created."
Error Handling:

If user creation fails due to system errors, the system should display an appropriate error message and log the error for further investigation.
Audit Log:

The system should log the creation of a new user, including the details of the admin who created the user and a timestamp.
Permissions:

Only users with admin privileges should be able to access the user creation form.
Accessibility:

The form should be accessible according to WCAG 2.1 guidelines, ensuring it can be used by people with disabilities.
