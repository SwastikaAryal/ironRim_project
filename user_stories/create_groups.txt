Description:
As a DevOps engineer, I want to be able to create new groups in the system and add members to these groups so that I can manage access control efficiently by assigning users to the appropriate groups, such as 'Contributor' and 'Reader'.

Acceptance Criteria:
Group Creation Form:

The system should provide a form with fields for entering group details: group name and description.
The form should include a section to add members to the group by selecting from a list of existing users.
Each field should be validated to ensure data integrity (e.g., group name length and characters).
Mandatory Fields:

The form should not be submitted if the mandatory field (group name) is missing.
Unique Constraints:

The group name must be unique. The system should display an error message if the group name already exists.
Description Field:

The description field should be optional and allow up to 500 characters.
Add Members:

The system should allow the admin to add users to the 'Contributor' and 'Reader' groups during the group creation process.
The admin should be able to select multiple users from a list of existing users.
The system should validate that the users being added are valid and exist in the system.
Success Message:

Upon successful creation, the system should display a confirmation message: "Group successfully created and members added."
Error Handling:

If group creation fails due to system errors, the system should display an appropriate error message and log the error for further investigation.
If adding members fails, the system should display an error message indicating which users could not be added and why.
Audit Log:

The system should log the creation of a new group, including the details of the DevOps engineer who created the group and a timestamp.
The system should log the addition of each member to the group, including the user details and a timestamp.
Permissions:

Only users with admin privileges should be able to access the group creation form and add members to groups.
Accessibility:

The form should be accessible according to WCAG 2.1 guidelines, ensuring it can be used by people with disabilities.
