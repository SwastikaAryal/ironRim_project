Description
The goal is to deploy a Virtual Network (VNet) and its associated subnets across all platform subscriptions. This will provide a structured and secure network environment for all platform services, ensuring proper segmentation, isolation, and management of network resources. The deployment should follow best practices for network security, scalability, and maintainability.

Acceptance Criteria
VNet Creation:

A Virtual Network (VNet) must be created for each platform subscription.
The VNet should be named according to the standard naming convention (e.g., VNet-<PlatformName>-<Region>).
Subnet Creation:

Subnets must be created within each VNet as per the platform requirements.
Each subnet should have a defined CIDR block that does not overlap with other subnets within the VNet.
Subnets should be named according to the standard naming convention (e.g., Subnet-<Purpose>-<Region>).
Network Security:

Network Security Groups (NSGs) must be associated with each subnet to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Default security rules should be defined based on the platform's security policy.
Routing:

Appropriate routing tables must be created and associated with each subnet.
Routes should be defined to allow necessary traffic and deny all other traffic as per security guidelines.
Integration and Connectivity:

VNets should be configured to enable peering with other VNets as required.
VNets should support connectivity to on-premises networks via VPN or ExpressRoute if needed.
Scalability:

The network architecture should be designed to accommodate future growth and additional subnets.
Address space allocation should consider potential expansion.
Documentation:

Comprehensive documentation must be provided, detailing the VNet and subnet configuration, security policies, and routing rules.
Documentation should include a network diagram illustrating the overall network architecture.
Testing:

Verify that all VNets and subnets are correctly deployed and configured.
Conduct connectivity tests to ensure that network traffic flows as expected.
Perform security testing to confirm that NSG rules are effectively protecting network resources.
