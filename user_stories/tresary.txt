User Story: Add A-Record to fiservbfs.com Public DNS and Provide Public IP from Azure
Description:
As a DevOps engineer, I want the Treasury team to add an A-Record to the fiservbfs.com public DNS and provide the public IP address from Azure, so that the domain resolves correctly and traffic is routed to the Azure Application Gateway.

Acceptance Criteria:

Provision Public IP Address:

A new public IP address is created in the Azure portal.
The public IP address is configured to be static.
The public IP address is documented and shared with the Treasury team.
Request to Treasury Team:

A formal request is submitted to the Treasury team to update the fiservbfs.com DNS settings.
The request includes details of the public IP address provided by Azure.
The request specifies that an A-Record needs to be added to point fiservbfs.com to the provided public IP address.
DNS Configuration by Treasury Team:

The Treasury team confirms receipt of the request and acknowledges the details.
The Treasury team updates the DNS settings for fiservbfs.com to include an A-Record pointing to the provided public IP address.
The Treasury team notifies the DevOps engineer once the DNS update is completed.
Verification:

The DNS propagation is confirmed through DNS lookup tools.
Verification that the domain fiservbfs.com resolves to the public IP address.
Ensure that the Azure Application Gateway is accessible via the fiservbfs.com domain
