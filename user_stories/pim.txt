Description: As a DevOps engineer, I want to set up Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in Entra ID (Azure AD) to manage and control elevated access for our team members, ensuring enhanced security and compliance.

Acceptance Criteria:

PIM Configuration:

Enable Privileged Identity Management in Entra ID.
Configure PIM to manage administrative roles for the organization.
Role Assignment:

Identify and assign eligible roles for PIM access (e.g., Global Administrator, Privileged Role Administrator, Security Administrator).
Assign team members to their respective PIM-eligible roles based on their responsibilities.
Access Policies:

Set up access policies for PIM roles:
Define approval workflows for role activation.
Set activation duration limits for temporary access.
Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) requirements for activation.
Configure notification settings for role activations and changes.
Just-in-Time Access:

Ensure that PIM is configured for just-in-time (JIT) access, allowing team members to request and activate roles only when needed.
Define and document procedures for requesting and activating PIM roles.
Audit and Monitoring:

Enable logging and monitoring for all PIM activities.
Set up alerts for unusual or unauthorized access attempts.
Schedule regular reviews of PIM access and activity logs.
Testing and Validation:

Verify that team members can request and activate PIM roles as per the defined policies.
Test the approval workflow and MFA requirements.
Confirm that access is granted only for the specified duration and automatically revoked after the time limit.
Document the setup process and validation results.
